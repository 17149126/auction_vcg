# auction_vcg
An Auction framework with VCG mechanism for scalable IAAS provisioning.

In could computing, effective resource allocation holds utmost importance. Resource allocation is an extremely challenging problem for both cloud and grid computing. Growth in the utilization of offered computational resources demands higher scalability and availability requirements nowadays. Improved resource utilization is responsible for enhanced profit among CSP’s and users with transformed revenue generation techniques but caused ineffective resource allocation due to high IAAS provisioning demands. Experimental validations of resource allocation-management systems are highly expensive and need extensive knowledge of cloud platforms. In the distributed architecture a centralized approach is applied where the problems of ineffective resource utilization, IAAS provisioning issues like collision, scalability, QoS related issues with a growing number of IAAS requests occur. My proposal is an Auction-framework with VCG mechanism which can be an effective solution to resolve some of the issues associated with resource provisioning and management in the cloud. The auction framework will be valuable for both the users and CSP’s in terms of profit. The experimental analysis will demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework.
